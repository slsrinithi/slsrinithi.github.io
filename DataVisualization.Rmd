# Data Visualization

## What is Data Visualization? 
Data visualization is a concept that refers to using visual design to convey data to people. Since people are more likely to look at an infographic as opposed to reading a paragraph, information visualizations is helpful. Data visualization involves being able to obtain data, filter the data, and present the data. This process involves knowing what needs to be conveyed and how to best communicate it to people. Data is being created all the time and everywhere, so being able to understand the data is important. 

## Who does Data Visualizations? 
The most common jobs that do data visualization are UX designers and data scientists. Both fields have the necessary tools to be able to obtain, filter, and present data. Data scientists may be more likely to have more coding skills and might be able to obtain data through APIs better whereas UX designers may be more likely to have more design skills that can be used to present the data. However, both careers can have coding and design skills. The coding language R is useful to obtain data sets from websites through the use of APIs. Visualizations such as graphs and maps that are based on data sets can also be made in using R. ggplot2 is a useful R package that can be installed to make graphs and maps. 

## How to visualize data? 
The first step is to come up with a question that needs to be answered. Then, the data set needs to be chosen. After that, the data has to be filtered so that only the data that is needed to answer the question is used. Finally, the data needs to be put into a visual format that is clear. Good visualizations are clear and intuitive to understand. This could be done through use of different colors, sizes, and shapes. Different graphs are useful in different scenarios. For example, a bar plot may be useful to show two views on one subject whereas a line plot may be useful to show trends. Using maps to visualize data is helpful when the data varies between geographical regions.

## Example of a visualization:
Here is a visualization that I made for a class using Tableau software (which is a software that can be used to make visualizations): ![Vizualization](Info_Viz_Deliverable.png) 
I was recognized for making good use of the stacked bar graph. However, I should not have made the x-axis scale from 0 to 13 for the line graph because the x-axis represents months, and there are only 12 months in a year. For the map, I used the darker color to represent the crime that I thought was the worst and the ligher color to reprent the crime that I thought was not as bad as the rest. However, it is important to consider that different people may have different opinions on which crime is worse than the other.
